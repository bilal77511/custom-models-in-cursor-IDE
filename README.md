# Using Custom Models in Cursor IDE

## Prerequisites
- **API Endpoint**: You'll need the endpoint (base URL) and an API key for the model you intend to use. For Groq, the endpoint is:
  ```
  https://api.groq.com/openai/v1
  ```
- **API Key**: Obtain an API key for the model provider (Groq, OpenAI, etc.).

## Step-by-Step Configuration

### 1. Open Cursor Settings
- Go to the Settings section in Cursor IDE. (Refer to the settings screen in the accompanying image).

### 2. Disable Current Models
- Disable any pre-enabled models in the list to avoid conflicts.

### 3. Add Your Custom Model
- Click on Add Model to configure a new model.

### 4. Override OpenAI Base URL
- Enable the Override OpenAI Base URL option.
- Enter the custom model's base URL. For Groq, use:
  ```
  https://api.groq.com/openai/v1
  ```
- Enter your API Key obtained from the model provider.

### 5. Verify and Activate
- Click on Verify to test the connection. If all goes well, the model should now be activated and ready for use in Cursor IDE.
